## Installation on Windows

You'll need to have a computer with the features detailed on the install page (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

You'll also need to have WSL 2 installed (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

Before installing Docker, ensure that the Linux kernel update package is installed (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package) and WSL 2 is set as the default version.

Windows Terminal is also recommened: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started

Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop and run the installer. Enable the extra WSL components when the installer gives you that option. Log out and back in again.

Start Docker Desktop from the start menu, and wait for it to start up. You might get a timeout error, but keep waiting. You can access it from the icon in the system tray. When it has started up successfully, you should see the status screen.
