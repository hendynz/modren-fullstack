## Installation on Windows

You'll need to have a computer with the features detailed on the install page (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

You'll also need to have WSL 2 installed (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

Before installing Docker, ensure that the Linux kernel update package is installed (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package) and WSL 2 is set as the default version.

Windows Terminal is also recommened: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started

Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop and run the installer. Enable the extra WSL components when the installer gives you that option. Log out and back in again.
